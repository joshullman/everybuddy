# Everybuddy
Cuz everybody is looking for a buddy

## Overview

I'm a musician and back in my home town I found it really difficult to find a buddy to play music with.  After speaking to other people about it, it occurred to me that it wasn't alone.  Tons of people out there are looking for study buddies, or biking buddies, or concert buddies.  People that are new to a city are looking for people to connect with and have to resort to dating websites to do so.  There's sites like Craigslist that doesn't have a great reputation, and sites like meetup that only really cater to large groups but nothing really in the middle.  There's no really great portal for people to go to find buddies to hang out with.  I'd like to create a site to try and fill this niche.  And for what may be the greatest accomplishment of my life, the name: Everybuddy.  Cuz everybody's looking for a buddy.  I don't think I've ever made a pun so cringingly amazing
